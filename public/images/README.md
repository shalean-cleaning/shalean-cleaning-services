# Hero Image Instructions

## Professional Cleaning Team Photo

The hero image is currently showing a placeholder. To display the actual professional cleaning team photo, add the image file to this directory.

### Image Requirements:

- **Location**: `public/images/cleaning-team-hero.jpg`
- **Recommended size**: 600x400 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG

### Image Description:
The photo should show:
- Three professional cleaners in blue Shalean Cleaning Services uniforms
- Working in a modern kitchen with light wooden cabinets
- Professional cleaning equipment (buckets, cloths, step ladder)
- Clean, bright environment showing quality work
- Professional and trustworthy appearance

### How to Add:
1. Save your professional cleaning team photo as `cleaning-team-hero.jpg`
2. Place it in the `public/images/` directory
3. The Hero section will automatically display it

### Current Status:
✅ Hero section updated to display the image

Once you add the image file, the Hero section will display your professional cleaning team photo instead of the placeholder!
